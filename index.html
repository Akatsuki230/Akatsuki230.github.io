            <p>Akatsuki is a programmer. She started a YouTube channel in 2019, mainly focusing on the game My Summer Car. Now, she covers more topics besides games.</p>

            <p>
                She has been active on her YouTube channel since then and enjoys exploring different aspects of gaming. Even though she creates various content, her love for My Summer Car remains
                strong.
            </p>
            <p>Since 2021, she has been making mods for My Summer Car. One of her notable mod was the Asphalt Roads mod in 2023.</p>
            <p>Apart from this, she manages a Discord bot called FemboyBot and many other projects, whether it's for a game or it's not a mod at all.</p>

            <h2>Why is the username different on every platform?</h2>
            <p>
                The username varies on different platforms because of availability. She adds numbers sequentially to her preferred name or uses her last name if all options are taken, based on her
                Discord tag.
